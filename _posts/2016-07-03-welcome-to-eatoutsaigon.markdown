2. Summarizes this comment and rating data into the following columns:
  + **Name:** The name of the restaurant.   <i class="material-icons">restaurant</i>

  + **Count:** The count of all unique comment ratings found.   <i class="material-icons">plus_one</i>
  + **Avg:** Value divided by Count.  Scale is 1-5.   <i class="material-icons">whatshot</i> / <i class="material-icons">plus_one</i> 
3. Displays the above data in an interesting and easy to use way.
